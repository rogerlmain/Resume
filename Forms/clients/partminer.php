	<h2>Senior Software Engineer</h2>

	<p>
		It was mostly my experience at PartMiner Inc. which got me the job at CapitalIQ but when I was with PartMiner there was no WebQL. Despite the
		limitations of the technology at the time, I still created an Internet "mining" tool to analyze web sites and extract information for
		increased productivity, using Java / J2EE.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was there I also designed and developed an Internet information extractor to maintain the company database of marketable information
		using the now-primative Delphi 5 as well as a recursive Internet mining and extraction program for increased productivity and intelligence using
		Visual Basic 6.0.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even at this early stage in my career I was involved in leadership activities as I trained co-workers in ASP, Java and JavaScript as technical backups.
		ASP, in particular, was a fairly new technology and I was glad that I could use the skills from my defunct teaching career in this effort.
