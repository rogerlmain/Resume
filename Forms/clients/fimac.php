	<p>
		I added value to the company by designing and developing the web-based version of their flagship budget modelling product.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before modern frameworks, I bolstered their development capabilities by creating a custom php framework and all visual components including treeviews, drag and drop operations and ajax-updated tables and table cells.
	</p>
	<p>
		To support these efforts I also designed and developed complex SQL queries for data retrieval to populated ajax enabled data tables.
	</p>
	<p>
		And, before jQuery, React or Angular (which I have since been using), I developed all of the native javascript routines for client-side visual effects including fade in / out, dynamic resizing and conditional data ajax retrieval (ie: retrieving treeview data as needed utilizing ajax functionality)
