	<p>
		When the department manager at NexData Solutions took a position at PartMiner Incorporated, he asked me to come along. In my time at NexData
		I had been a technical lead on a New York trip with the sales team and was instrumental in landing a major contract for the development of the
		corporate e-commerce web site for the Langenscheidt book publishing firm. In addition, I designed the site. I left before development began, however,
		but I did design and create the company Intranet system.
