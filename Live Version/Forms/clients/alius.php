	<h1>Alius Health</h1>
	<h2>Senior Software Developer / Team Lead</h2>
	
	<p>
		I was involved in some development work, refreshing my dormant C# programming skills, as well as designing a document management
		system. I also streamlined their production release cycle and data import using a product called ArcESB.
	</p>

	<p>
		Perhaps my best achievement at Alius was organizing two projects through their entire lifecycle, from initial design to deployment. 
		I was responsible for creating and assigning the tasks in GIT.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I also acted as Team Lead, implementing a weekly developersâ€™ meeting that turned out to be a very successful forum by providing a 
		forum for the programmers to find solutions to problems, both technical and political. I was able to utilize my Toastmasters skills 
		by providing a buffer between management and the guys in the trenches.
