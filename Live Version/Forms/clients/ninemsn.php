	<h1>NineMSN Pty Ltd &dash; Sydney, Australia</h1>
	<h2>Contract Programmer</h2>

	<p>
		NineMSN (a child company of Microsoft and the Channel 9 Network) was my baptism into ASP and the last job I had before leaving Australia.
		I worked on many sites for them including Getaway Travel (the Australian forerunner to Expedia), Money (a web version of the print
		publication), Dolly Magazine, Wine Society Magazine and Telstra Big Pond (Australia's premier phone company). I also designed and
		developed various temporary, interstitial and redirectional pages to maintain company image and attract advertisers.
