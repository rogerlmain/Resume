	<p>
		In order to track customer usage to increasing sales, I installed and configured a Cassandra noSQL database
	</p>
	<p>
		For the purpose of conforming to the industry standard, I was also instrumental by creating client services to export energy usage data to the Green Button XML data format.
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps my proudest achievement, I increased performance of the Equipment Marketplace section of their Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) website – the cornerstone of their company product – by 97% by redesigning and redeveloping the internal structure to increasing the efficiency of cataloging product information retrieved from APIs for Amazon (AWS), Best Buy, Sears, Shopping.com and ShopToIt.ca (for Canadian clients)
