	<p>
		Along with support programming and script development for their web mining operation, I designed and developed their
		Document Feed service to expedite the delivery of web mined documents to their client companies. In addition, I was heavily
		involved in creating various scripts using (the very obscure) WebQL technology for analyzing web sites and identifying and
		downloading relevant documents pertaining to the financial sector. This was of particular interest to the parent company,
		Standards &amp; Poors.
