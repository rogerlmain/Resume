		This was the last job that I did for an Australian company. While working at NextData I moonlighted by writing articles for the Australian
		publication which included a feature article on, what at the time was the latest technology: ASP-VBScript. I also wrote a five part series
		of articles instructing beginners on Sun's Java Development Kit (to version 1.2). This led to a regular monthly Question and Answer column
		which I designed and developed a website specifically for.
