	<h2>Software Developer / Project Manager</h2>

	<p>
		I was with Eagle:XM for three and a half years, supporting and enhancing their flagship "Broadband Insights" product
		for delivering statistical information of users for various cable television companies. This information was considered
		critical to their marketing strategy. By targetting direct mailings to a statistically more inclined audience, Eagle:XM
		boasted a return three times higher than other direct marketing companies.
	</p>

	<p>
		I also helped to keep them on the cutting edge of technology by designing and developing various in-house tools
		including the main data warehouse to replace the existing DOS based system.
