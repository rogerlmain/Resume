	<h1>OnCommand Corporation &dash; Denver, CO</h1>
	<h2>Software Developer</h2>

	<p>
		I have two achievements at OnCommand (later LodgeNet and now Sonifi). One was designing and developing their primary database
		analysis and viewing tools, thus reducing costs in licensing fees for their existing systems.
	</p>
	<p>
		The other was designing and developing their in-house project management intranet system in order to streamline their project
		development lifecycle; a project which has contributed greatly to my software development project management experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition I was involved in support programming for their existing hotel network analysis and updating tools.
