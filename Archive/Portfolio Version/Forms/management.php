				<p>
					In addition to my extensive experience as a software developer, I have managed many projects from initial concept to final deployment.
					As a contractor, it is necessary to manage all aspects of product development.

				<p>
					As such I have liaised with customers in order to determine their requirements and have had to quickly learn about their business and 
					to provide a roadmap to a solution for their technical needs and desires.

				<p>
					I have also been required to determine the best technologies to suit their requirements, schedule the development as well as provide 
					technical services. At various times, I have employed third-party programmers to complete projects on time. In addition, I have extensive 
					experience managing volunteers as an executive of various chapters of Toastmasters International, which has also helped substantially in
					improving my communication and leadership skills.

					Tools used in project management include Atlassian JIRA and Microsoft Project as well as the Agile development methodology. To further
					increase my skills, I have Project Management Certification and continue to study at Arapahoe Community College (once a client of mine).
